I have no other choice except to modify the bundle ID of CercubePlus (Legacy). Thus, you won't be able to install CercubePlus (Legacy) directly through AltStore. You still can download the IPA like normal though.

Full infomation about CercubePlus (Legacy) is available on my Github: https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus/tree/iOS-12/

Credits: Please keep the Credits if you re-up CercubePlus (Legacy)! 
- Alfhaily for Cercube.
- Galactic-Dev for the original iSponsorBlockLegacy, @Luewii for his fork of iSponsorBlock (which works in jailed mode).
- PoomSmart for YouRememberCaption, YTClassicVideoQuality, YTNoCheckLocalNetwork, YTSystemAppearance, and Return YouTube Dislike.
- level3tjg for YTNoHoverCards.

Known issues:
- YTUHD is removed because most iOS 12 devices don't support VP9 codec (Hardware restriction).
- iOS 12 doesn't have the built-in Picture in Picture mode like iOS 14+, so YouPiP must be removed as well.
- Hide Cast button may not work.
- YouPiP (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the speedup-bug as described here. The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable Legacy PiP is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou. Use it at your own risk!",

Attention:
- If you like the app, considering support the developers!
- YTUHD is not stable atm. You might encounter stuttering, heat, battery drain..., especially when playing at 2160p (4K) quality. However, this should not happen if you use TrollStore.
- Unless you're using TrollStore, deep-link (aka Open in the YouTube App) simply will not work.
